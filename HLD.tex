	\chapter{Introduction}
	
	\section{Purpose}
	
	The FH++ app, which is being developed as part of this software project, is intended to be a useful tool for students at the FH Campus Wien and is meant to be an addition to existing services like FH Portal and Moodle. \\ \\
	The goal is to offer users of the app the opportunity to make their studies as efficient as possible.
	By using the interfaces of the FH portal and those of the open data portal of the City of Vienna, which enables access to data from Wiener Linien,
	the users should be empowered to plan their everyday studies in a time-optimizing manner.
	The arrival at the FH can be planned by combining information from the individual timetable and current traffic data for public transport. \\
	As an example, in case the metro U1 is used for getting to the FH, the app is intended to warn of a potentially later arrival time in the event of disruptions in the subway network.
	For navigation within the FH building, the user should be able to use a navigation aid. \\
	In addition, the app should also allow to read and send emails from the FH mail account.
	
	\section{Organizational Embedding}
	The project takes place as part of the ILV Software Engineering course. The students of the Vienna University of Applied Sciences should benefit from the application.

	\chapter{Non-Functional Requirements}
	\section{Requirements for data retention}
	The application must comply with the DSGVO and Austrian laws and standards
	correspond. An implementability of the corresponding guidelines of the DSGVO must be ensured, e.g. how long the data may be kept, whether the members
	must take note of a privacy policy, that the data will not be passed on to third parties and that the data can be deleted upon request can be carried out.
	
	\section{General description of the data}
	The system must be expandable: new members and modules should be able to
	be added, but also be able to be deleted. The names
	of the modules and the names of the members should be changeable. Data must be
	be checked for authenticity before they are added to the database.
	
	\section{Performance requirement}
	The data provided through the system must be refreshed immediately after a change happened: The user needs to be get the newest information within half a minute. Also refreshing the data on the app must not take longer than 10 seconds.
	
	\section{Installation and Tutorial}
	The application must be self-explanatory: The average user should be able to use the application with all its functions in a matter of 15 minutes. The context of the menu and the application as such, must be in a user-friendly, easy to understand way.
	
	\section{Accessibility}
	Accessible design must be integrated into the application: Text size, font, colours and menus must be tuned, as to enable as many people with accessibility difficulties as possible, to use the app in an efficient and easy way.
	
	\section{Data security}
	Login credentials and other sensitive information must be stored and transmitted only in a encrypted state. At no time in the system is any sensitive data allowed to be in cleartext. Modern up to date encryption must be used to ensure data safety.
	
	\section{Multiple platforms}
	The application must be available on all modern platforms to be useable by every student on every machine: to reach this goal the application must be compatible with the top ten modern browsers available at the moment.
