	\section{Purpose}
	Currently the timetable of the course of study for 'Computer Science and Digital Communications' is still being set up manually without any tool support.\\\\
	Consider the following:\\
	Every student is assigned a group and each of those groups has an individual timetable that needs to be consistent in itself. Some lecture courses should be finished earlier	within a semester than others, meaning a time window has to be considered for every course when setting up the timetable for a specific year group. Moreover, there might a predefined sequence of lectures and exercises for a course, some lecturers might only be available on certain days of the week, different courses taking	place on the same day should all be either online or on-site, students might want that exams are well spread over time to balance work load, ... etc.\\\\
	Having a look at the vast number of constraints that have to be considered in setting up the timetable one can easily imagine that this is a time-consuming and tedious task when done without any tool support. Therefore, a software support should be developed that allows an efficient way to set up consistent timetables for each group
