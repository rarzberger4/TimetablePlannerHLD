	\section{Purpose}
	
	The FH++ app, which is being developed as part of this software project, is intended to be a useful tool for students at the FH Campus Wien and is meant to be an addition to existing services like FH Portal and Moodle. \\ \\
	The goal is to offer users of the app the opportunity to make their studies as efficient as possible.
	By using the interfaces of the FH portal and those of the open data portal of the City of Vienna, which enables access to data from Wiener Linien,
	the users should be empowered to plan their everyday studies in a time-optimizing manner.
	The arrival at the FH can be planned by combining information from the individual timetable and current traffic data for public transport. \\
	As an example, in case the metro U1 is used for getting to the FH, the app is intended to warn of a potentially later arrival time in the event of disruptions in the subway network.
	For navigation within the FH building, the user should be able to use a navigation aid. \\
	In addition, the app should also allow to read and send emails from the FH mail account.
